We're joined by four upper level graduate students--Ted Ellsworth, SoRelle Gaynor, Alauna Safarpour, and Tiago Ventura--in the department who share their experiences attending external programs, reflect on the pros and cons of each, and offer further information on the programs in the documents below:
