This repository introduces Git and GitHub as tools of workflow management.

- For introduction, please see "Version Control using Git and GitHub" (video, [slides](https://github.com/EandrewJones/gvpt-methods/tree/master/versioncontrol/slides_vc_short.pdf)). The talk covers the concept of version control and a short walkthrough of using basic git commands.

- I highly recommend taking a look at Jenny Bryan's [Happy Git and GitHub for the use](https://happygitwithr.com/) and Matthew Gentzkow and Jesse M. Shapiro's []()

- Additional resources will be updated soon for interested users who prefer using Git through [RStudio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
