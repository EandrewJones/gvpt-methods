## Description

This repository introduces Git and GitHub as tools of workflow management.

- For introduction, please see "Version Control using Git and GitHub" ([video](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rtwnh4hk7ilo6o2/version-control-khpark.mp4?dl=0), [slides](https://github.com/EandrewJones/gvpt-methods/tree/master/versioncontrol/slides_vc_short.pdf)). The talk covers the concept of version control and a short walkthrough of using basic git commands.

- I highly recommend taking a look at Jenny Bryan's [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) and Matthew Gentzkow and Jesse M. Shapiro's [Code and Data for the Social Sciences: A Practitioner’s Guide](https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.pdf).

- Additional resources will be updated soon for interested users who prefer using Git through [RStudio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
